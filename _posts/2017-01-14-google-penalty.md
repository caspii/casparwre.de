title: Getting hit by an app store penalty
---

I recently observed what I can only assume is a Google penalty on Google Play. One of [my apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.casparwre.insult) has around 250 downloads per day. These are purely organic installs and I have not run any campaigns for over a year.

On the 5th of January I noticed a sudden usage and install spike. As luck would have it, I had real-time Google analytics open at the time, otherwise I would have missed it. Usually between 1-10 people are using the app at any one time but this suddenly increased to around 40. I'll never know exactly what caused it, but I'm guessing it was a mention on live radio or TV.

By the next day, the usage numbers had returned to normal. However, I saw a dramatic 100% decrease in installs that have still not recovered. Because all other things remained equal, I can only assume that the sudden increase in users raised a flag at Google who applied a penalty to my app.

I'm assuming that the installs will return to normal and of course it's no big loss for me. But I do wonder what would happen to a commercial app (which pays people's wages) were it hit by a similar usage spike.
