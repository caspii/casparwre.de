It's surprisingly hard to write the copy for your product landing page: one trap that is very easy to fall into is using your own language and not the customer's when describing the product.

> What the company says: "Our Dermaglow cream is a sophisticated blend of micro-nutrients, rare botanicals, and innovative moisture-binding compounds that rejuvenate and revitalize your skin at a cellular level."

> What customers say: "This lotion makes my face feel less like an old leather bag and more like a baby's butt. Plus, it smells like lavender, not like a science lab."

You get the idea. 

## How to fix this?

You fix it by letting the customers write the copy. And instead of using expensive and time-consuming focus groups, you use ... AI. Yes, I am afraid this is another post about ChatGPT.

Proceed as follows:

1. In your onsite feedback survey, add the following question: "What do you like about our product?".
2. Once you have enough answers, feed it into ChatGPT and ask it to write some landing page copy.
3. Profit!

I just fed 400 answers into ChatGPT and it produced the following for Keepthescore.com. It's surprising good, considering I said nothing about what my product actually does in the prompt:
