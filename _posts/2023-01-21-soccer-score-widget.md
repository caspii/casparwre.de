title: Online soccer score widget for your website
---

This is a post demonstrating how to embed a soccer score widget from [Keepthescore.co](https://keepthescore.co/soccer-football-scoreboard/). What's really nice is that it will update automatically without the page reloading.

1. First of all you need to go over to [Keepthescore.co](https://keepthescore.co/soccer-football-scoreboard/) and create your leaderboard. You can do this without registering or providing an email address. Pretty cool, no?
2. Click the "SHOW AND SHARE" button at the top of your board.
3. Click the "Add scoreboard to a Website" Panel and then "COPY CODE TO CLIPBOARD"
4. Paste the code into your page (e.g. Wordpress, Wix, Square, etc.)
5. That's it!

Here's what an embedded scoreboard looks like:

You can now update the widget on Keepthescore.com and it will update automatically on your website.
