title: A tool to present user stories
---

The legendary computer scientist [Donald E. Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) was in the middle of writing a series of books, when he realised that the typesetting systems of the day weren't to his satisfaction. So he did what any tinkerer in his situation would do, which is <del>epically procrastinate</del> interrupt his writing and make a better system first. Eight years later his mission was complete and he had built the best [typesetting system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) in the world. He then went back to writing his books.

Anyway, I'm no Donald E. Knuth but recently I wanted to discuss a bunch of user stories with my development team and decided it would be best to have one user story per presentation slide. That way, we could concentrate on discussing a user story at a time and not be distracted by other stories.

I was sure that there must be some tool to take rows in a Google Sheet and turn them into a presentation. But I was wrong (or couldn't find it). So I made [Slides2Sheets](http://trsc.github.io/sheets2slides/), a very simple webapp that turns Google Sheets into a presentation. And it didn't take me 8 years either.
