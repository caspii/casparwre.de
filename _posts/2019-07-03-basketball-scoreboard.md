title: A new type of basketball scoreboard
---
Why are basketball scoreboards so expensive? You can easily pay over 3000 USD for
a hardware scoreboard! Of course you could download a a basketball
scoreboard software for your computer and then display the result on a large monitor or
projector. However, the software solutions have other problems:

* They often only run on one type of computer (e.g. Windows)
* They have a terrible usability
* They are still fairly expense
* They are all ugly!

So here's a new solution: *a basketball scoreboard that runs in your browser*. It looks like this:

!['basketball scoreboard'](/images/basketball-scoreboard.png){:class="img-responsive"}

This means you need to download no software at all and it runs on every computer that has a browser --
which is basically all of them. Another huge advantage is that you can share your scoreboard
remotely with other people: simply send them a link.
