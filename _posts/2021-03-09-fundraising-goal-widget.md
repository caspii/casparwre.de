title: How to embed an online fundraising widget
---

This is a post demonstrating how to embed a fundraising widget from [keepthescore.com](https://keepthescore.com) on a web page. 

What's quite nice is that it will update automatically without the page reloading or having to touch the embed code.

Here's what an embedded thermometer looks like:

<iframe id="iframe-cxxxxlrqykthr" src="https://keepthescore.com/embed/cxxxxlrqykthr/" style="width:100%;border:none;"></iframe><script>window.onmessage = (e) => {if (e.data.hasOwnProperty("frameHeight"))    {document.getElementById("iframe-" + e.data.board_token).style.height = `${e.data.frameHeight +40}px`}}</script>

## How to add your own widget

1. First of all you need to go over to [keepthescore.com](https://keepthescore.com/fundraising-thermometer/) and create your thermometer. You can do this without registering or providing an email address. Pretty cool, no?
2. Click the "PUBLISH" button at the top of your board.
3. Click the "Embed on a Website" Panel and then "COPY TO CLIPBOARD"
4. Paste the code into your page (e.g. Wordpress, Wix, Square, etc.)
5. That's it!

You can  now update the widget on Keepthescore.com, and it will update automatically on your website.
