title: Creating an online scoreboard with Python Flask.
---

I wanted to learn something new and decided to make a webapp using Python Flask. Webapps are often under-appreciated next to their native cousins, especially when some kind of collaboration is required. Not only are webapps an order of magnitude easier to implement, their usability can be actually superior to native apps in certain situations, something that has been wonderfully demonstrated by [Kittysplit.com](https://kittysplit.com).

I searched around for an idea and pretty soon decided to make a scoreboard for keeping track of scores in a group. Not only was it a very easy use-case, but it required collaboration too. A scan of the Google Play stored showed that there are at least 20 apps trying to solve the problem. Some are [pretty](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nolanlawson.keepscore) [good](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.publicobject.rounds), most are not. All of them have the same problem that it's very hard to share a scoreboard with someone else and -- you've guessed it -- colloborating.

So here's my take: [Keethescore.co: a webapp for keep score](http://keepthescore.co). Let me know what you think.
