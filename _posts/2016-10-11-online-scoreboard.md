title: Creating an online scoreboard with Python Flask.
---

I recently wanted to learn something new and decided to make a webapp using Python Flask. Webapps are often under-appreciated next to their native cousins, especially when some kind of user collaboration is required. Not only are webapps an order of magnitude easier to implement, their usability can actually be superior to native apps in certain situations, something that has been wonderfully demonstrated by [Kittysplit.com](https://kittysplit.com).

So I searched around for an idea and hit upon making a scoreboard for keeping track of scores in a group. A scan of the Google Play Store showed that there are at least 20 apps trying to solve the problem. Some are [pretty](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nolanlawson.keepscore) [good](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.publicobject.rounds), most are not. All of them have the same problem: it's very hard to share a scoreboard with someone else and -- you've guessed it -- collaborate.

So here's what I made: [Keethescore.co: a webapp for keeping score](http://keepthescore.co). Let me know what you think.
