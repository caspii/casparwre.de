title: Replacing Launchrock with Flask

I've being playing around with Python Flask recently and my first project is a self-hosted replacement for Launchrock. All it does is throw up a landing page and a signup form. Get the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/caspii/flask-landingpage).

My next Flask project will be a web-based scoreboard, or a scorekeeper if you will. Stay tuned!
