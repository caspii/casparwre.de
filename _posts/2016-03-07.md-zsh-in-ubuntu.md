All the cool kids are using z-shell instead of bash these days. I won't go into the details here, other saying the following:

* zsh has much better tab completion behavior
* it makes working with git much more pleasant and productive, such as showing the current branch you're in. (See screenshot)

Here's what  you need to do to install zsh, install "Oh My zsh" and get the fonts working

## 1. Install prerequisite packages

`sudo apt-get install git-core zsh`

## 2. Install Oh My Zsh

`curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh`

If you saw an error massage like one of the following `chsh: PAM: Authentication failure then the script is having trouble setting ZSH as the default shell`

We'll do that next.

## 3. Set it to be the default shell

`chsh -s /bin/zsh`

You'll only see this is in action once you've rebooted (at the end)

## 4. Get the fonts required for a fancy theme
Install this font repo (you can delete it afterwards):

 `git clone git@github.com:powerline/fonts.git`

Run the install script:
```
cd fonts
./install
```

## 5. Set up a fancy theme
Open up ~./zshrc and change `ZSH_THEME` variable:

``ZSH_THEME="agnoster"


## 6. Reboot
You're ready to go.
