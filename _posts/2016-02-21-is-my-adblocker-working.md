title: How to tell if your adblocker is working
---
So you've installed an adblocker (or a "content" blocker if you're on iOS). But how do your actually know that it works?

I created a very simple page that will give you the answer: [Adblock detector](http://casparwre.de/adblock-detector/). The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/caspii/casparwre.de/blob/master/adblock-detector/index.html) by the way.

Of course, if you're on Android, chances are that you can't install an Ablocker, which is very sad indeed.

If you have questions, do ask below.
