title: Unix 101 Course
---

This is a course I gave privately to some friends. You can still do the
exercises, even if you didn't take part in the course.


## Background info

[Here's](https://www.howtogeek.com/182649/htg-explains-what-is-unix/) a good history of Unix.

You'll need to have a server login to do the exercises -- or your own Linux installation.

To connect to my server, use `ssh <your_username>@b3rlin.net`. If I haven't given you a login, then you can't do this!

By the way: if you get your password wrong three times in a row, your
IP address will be blacklisted for 30mins! If this happens you must be
patient.
