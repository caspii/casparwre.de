<h2>Homework</h2>
Use the "man" command to read up on all the commands we used. You will also
need to read about the 2 commands that we didn't use (listed above).<br>
<br>
Remember: To make a script called <em>scriptname</em> and run it, you must
follow these steps
<ol>
  <li>Write script with nano <em>scriptname </em> and exit Nano</li>
  <li>carry out the following command : chmod +x <em>scriptname</em></li>
  <li>run it as follows (and whilst in the same directory): ./<em>scriptname</em></li>
</ol>
Create a directory called "homework101" in your home directory. The three
scripts you write should be located here.<br>
<br>
Write a script called "info" that outputs the following:
<pre>	Hello world!<br>	I am a script located in the following location:<br>	&lt;working directory here&gt;	<br>	I am being run by the following user:<br>	&lt;username&gt;<br>	on the following system:<br>	&lt;hostname&gt;<br>	Goodbye.<br></pre>Next write a script called "mailme" that takes the output from the "info" script, puts it in a cow and sends it in a mail with<br>
<ul>
  <li>You as the reciever</li>
  <li>The subject line "homework"</li>
  <li>Also add undercover.operations@gmail.com as a reciever of the mail</li>
</ul>Finally, create a directory called "backup" in your home
directory. Write a script called "backup-homework" that copies
everything in your homework directory into the backup directory:
<ul> 
<li>The script should copy all the stuff in the homework directory,
regardless of what's in it. In other words, you should not be
explicitly specifying by name which files to copy.
</li><li>HINT: You will probably need to "recursively" copy. Check out the cp man-page. Or use the "*" option</li>
</ul>
