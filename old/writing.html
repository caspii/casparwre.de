		When I was studying in London I used to write short fiction stories for the student magazine. Not all of them were published and quite a few of them were embarrassing adolescent twaddle. Some of them weren't and you can download them here. I would appreciate some feedback :-)
		<br><br>
		The main reason why I no longer write is that I can no longer easily reach a very large audience quickly and with minimal effort. And I was never given an advance of 500K.
		<br><br>
		The <strong>bold </strong>ones are probably better than the rest.
