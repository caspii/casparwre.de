This is the story of how I accidentally discovered what appears to be a massive SEO scam.

## Summary
Some highly-ranked tools for editing or "cleaning" HTML seem to be secretly injecting links into their output to push themselves and 
affiliated sites up the search engine rankings. This scam is highly successful and seems to have gone undetected so far.

Tools which appear to be doing this are all made by the same people:

* html-cleaner.com
* html-online.com/editor/
* html5-editor.net
* htmlg.com

Sites that have fallen victim to this include BoingBoing, the official German Football Association and Kaspersky. The delicious irony here is that the affected Kaspersky article is about "staying safe from hackers".  

## Finding something fishy

So here's a blow-by-blow account of how I made this disovery, along with the evidence I uncovered.

It all began with a mystery concerning a product that I'm building. The product is an online scoreboard, and despite having (what I think) is a solid SEO strategy, I have been unable to conquer that coveted top spot in the search engine results page. For the last 12 months, a product called "Scorecounter" has always been ahead of me.

Now, due to the nature of my product, people are sharing links to it and embedding it in their websites, which means that over time I am accumulating a lot of inbound links. The competitor does not have this advantage, yet was consistently better at me than SEO. What were they doing?

So last night I drank 2 glasses of red wine and instead of deleting the production database (like last time) I decided to get to the bottom of it. I got a paid subscription for [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) (an excellent SEO tool) and had a look at the "backlink profile" of Scorecounter. This is what I found:

Scorecounter had 3600 incoming links which it had accumulated in a very short time. Impressive! Then I began to look at the pages that contained the links and this is where I grew suspicious.

For instance, I saw a [blog post from the German Football Association](https://www.dfb.de/en/news/detail/loew-ter-stegen-will-be-in-goal-225988/?no_cache=1) containing a link to Scorecounter. The word that was linked was "score" -- yet having a link here made absolutely no sense in the context of the article. What was going on?

Other non-sensical links I found:

* [Intuit Quickbooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/au/quickbooks-online-accountant/package-offer/terms/)
* [NBC Washington](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/sports/nbcsports/lars-eller-says-tom-wilsons-hits-in-scrum-with-rangers-werent-a-big-deal/2660863/)
* [RICE University](https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/online-mds/faqs)
* [Macworld Shop](https://shop.macworld.com/sales/lenovo-mirage-ar-ar-7562b-headset-4-3-display-marvel-dimension-of-heroes-new)

There were pages and pages of these (take a look for yourself if you have an Ahrefs account). So I wrote some emails to a 1-2 of these sites and asked them why they had these links in their pages. Were they selling links (always a possibility)?.

## Bingo!
I recieved the following reply

>Thanks for reaching out. No, we do not sell links at any cost.

>I was actually using an HTML cleaner (html-online.com/editor/) since last year, which was working fine as intended in the initial months but a few weeks back I realised that the tool has suddenly started secretly injecting links to the HTML content.

>For a few posts, I was not able to spot it, but when I learnt about it, whatever post I could have recall, were cleaned manually. It appears, unfortunately, some of them are still there, as you pointed out. I will today simply find-replace this link from the entire database for safer side.

Aha! So that was what was going on. The creators of Scorecounter also made an online HTML editor which injects links attached to keywords. The beauty of this scam is that by injecting links to their own HTML editor, they have created a wonderful positive feedback loop: the higher it rises in the search rankings, the more people use it and the more secret links they can inject.

Some examples:

* [Focusonthefamily.com](https://www.focusonthefamily.com/get-help/codependency-what-is-it/)
* [Medium.com Article](https://medium.com/@johnsteve2879/salicylamide-market-business-strategies-2020-2025-pointing-to-capture-industry-growth-rate-risk-c9e46e277951)

Now if you are feeling very magnanimous, you could argue that the editor is a freemium tool, and that added links are how you pay for the free version. OK, fine: add a link to the tool itself. But now consider the following section:

## Mystery of the Rubik's cube
Another site that is made by the same people is Ruwix.com which is all about the famous puzzle cube. Again it's very easy to find a large number of backlinks to Ruwix.com on random sites, each of them a total non-sequitur:

* [an article about Sex and the City](https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2018/02/kim-cattrall-tells-sarah-jessica-parker-stop-exploiting-tragedy)
* [a BoingBoing article](https://boingboing.net/2017/06/27/a-review-of-cosmic-trigger-a.html)
* and my perosnal favorite: [a blog post on Kaspersky.com](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-hackers-scammers)


## A whole network of tools
By skimming the backlinks it appears that there is a whole network of tools that are doing a similar thing. All have similar backlink profiles. They include:

* htmltidy.net
* html-css-js.com
* divtable.com
* html-cleaner.com
* html5-editor.net
* htmlg.com

## So is this really against Google's rules?
To be honest, I don't really


## But link injection is mentioned in the
