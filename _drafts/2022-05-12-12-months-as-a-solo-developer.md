HI, I'm Caspar. I quit my job last year to build and market my own online product. You can read the blog post I wrote about getting started
here.

Now it's time for a retrospective, to reveal some numbers, go through some highlights and lowlights, and peer into the future. 
I'll try and do this every 12 months, for as long as I can.

## Going solo: the good bits

First off, what does it feel like to go it alone? Am I lonely? Missing the office? Missing colleagues? Afraid?

The answer is: it feels flipping awesome. I already feel that I have been lost to the world of employment forever. I mean, just imagine: 
* I have not attended a single meeting for over a year
* I get to choose who my customers are (more on that later)
* I get to work in an office that is beautiful and over which I have 100% sovereignty.
* I am constantly investing in a better future for myself (and by extension for my family).

Do I miss human contact during the day? Well, I can meet up with friends for lunch. And I do, 
usually once a week. The other thing is: I'm currently sharing my house with 8 other people. What's even more unusual is that I am the only male and everyone else is female. But let's not digress. Ask me when you meet me. The point is: loneliness is not a problem.

I'm also doing more exercise than ever before and have lost quite a bit of weight.

## Going solo: the bad bits

What are the disadvantages? Motivation is sometimes a problem. I don't always hit my weekly targets. On some days there are so many chores and family interruptions that I feel like I made no progress. But looking back on my employment, interruptions happened all the time. 

Motivation?


## How do I earn money?

I earn money in 2 ways:

* Through Keepthescore.co, my online product, and 
* by building custom solutions.

Keepthescore.co made X USD in gross revenue in the 12 months, beginning in March 2021, and on top of that I made Y USD by building custom solutions. Let's go into some more detail.

### Keepthescore.co revenue
People using Keepthescore.co have to pay to get certain extra features. It's a one-off payment which currently costs 5.99 USD. In March 2021, when my journey started, this revenue stream was bringing in around 460 USD per month. My goal was to triple this in 12 months.

It was a goal I achieved: in March 2022 the product was making 1560 USD per month. (However, my celebrations were short-lived, because in the following month my revenue dropped by over 20%. It seems to be a seasonal thing, because traffic dropped too. The thing is, I can never be 100% sure).

Anyway, I intend to bring establish 2 new revenue streamsin the next 12 months. The first is advertising the other is a subscription model.

**Overall, my goal is to triple my revenue again so by March 2023 I want to be at 4500 USD.** We'll see how that works out...

### Ads on Keepthescore.co

Advertising has already landed on Keepthescore.co: users have been seeing ads from Google Adsense since February 2022. So far, the returns have been meagre: around 6 USD per day. 

I am hoping to switch to another ad provider but this is proving difficult. There's 2  providers that I am interested in (AdThrive and MediaVine) but both require Google Analytics to be installed on my site. This is annoying, because I announced [with great fanfare that I removed Google Analytics from the site](https://casparwre.de/blog/stop-using-google-analytics/). I have now sheepishly added Google Analytics back to the site, in the hope that one of these 2 ad providers will accept me üòî.

### SEO for Keepthescore.co

The area where I learned a lot over the past 12 months is SEO. SEO (or search engine optimisation) is the name for all work and initiatives that will move your site closer to the top of the search engine results page for particular search terms. Below you can see that my product is on the top spot for when searching for `online scoreboard`.

!['Nebelmeer'](/images/google-search-scoreboard.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The site you see at the next spot (Scorecount) was beating me for a long time. After ignoring this for some time, I eventually got round to taking a closer look at this competitor. It turns out that they were running a massive SEO scam operation. [I wrote a blog post about this which is a good yarn](https://casparwre.de/blog/seo-scam/). After publishing this post, Google punished the site and I am now number 1 üèÜ. Just to be clear, the main reason I was able to pull this off was a huge amount of luck.

Almost all of my SEO efforts are now focussed on producing new and relevant content. The basic thing to get right is to have high-quality content that answers a question that someone will ask on Google. I try and write one of these articles per month and post them onto the Keepthescore.co blog.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ü§ùI&#39;ve committed to writing one blog post per week as part of my marketing efforts.<br><br>‚úçÔ∏èI always do it on a Thursday and it&#39;s hard.<br><br>‚≠êÔ∏èBut it&#39;s beginning to pay off. That makes it progressively less hard.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/buildinpublic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#buildinpublic</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SEO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SEO</a> <a href="https://t.co/vNJEtaxuEH">pic.twitter.com/vNJEtaxuEH</a></p>&mdash; Caspar v. Wrede ‚ú® (@wrede) <a href="https://twitter.com/wrede/status/1506935233043697667?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

My best performing post is entitled "[How to create a leaderboard using Google Sheets](https://keepthescore.co/blog/posts/create-google-sheets-leaderboard/)" and is a good example of the type of content I am trying to create:
* It aims to be high quality. No waffle. Short sentences.
* It is a direct answer to a specific search query ("How do I create a leaderboard using Google Sheets").
* It contains a link to my product, but only right at the end.

So far, my strategy for producing content seems to be working. Here is how the traffic to the blog has developed

## Custom solutions

In 2019 the first person got in touch asking for a bespoke scoreboard, because the standard ones didn't fit their needs. I decided that I would give it a try to see if I could establish a new revenue stream: making custom scoreboards as a kind of niche web-development agency. That first custom scoreboard was quite wonky and almost broke down several times. However, the customer paid and my new revenue stream was established.

On average I now build one custom scoreboard a month. On top of having an alternative renenue stream it, it's also a good way of discovering new needs and solutions that may be worth turning into a self-serve product.

My most prestigious customer was Guinness World of Records, who needed a digital stop-gap solution during the pandemic. The coolest thing is that this work led to my name actually appearing in the Guinness World of Records:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">True story: I made a scoreboard for the Guinness World of Records and now my name is in the Guiness Book of Records ü•≥<br><br>(Under acknowledgements, but still....) <a href="https://t.co/itNgnUDq55">pic.twitter.com/itNgnUDq55</a></p>&mdash; Caspar v. Wrede ‚ú® (@wrede) <a href="https://twitter.com/wrede/status/1485550627761668101?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I have tried to create a "productised" package for customers wanting a custom solution. [Here is the landing page I made for my services](https://keepthescore.co/custom-scoreboard/), which also includes some examples. 

Overall, it's good to have another revenue stream independent of my main product. The only downside is that when I am working on custom solutions, I am not working on my product. This is the reason why I recently doubled my prices to focus more on my product. It had the desired effect: I've had no new customers at the new price point. Once I'm ready for more custom work, I will lower my prices again.
